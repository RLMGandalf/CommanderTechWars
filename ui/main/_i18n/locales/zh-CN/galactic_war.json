He proceeded to construct several weapons platforms and dared anyone to try and take it from him. The Machine Liberation Army (MLA) did just that early in the Pro-Com War, deeming Agint of high strategic value.

        "message": "Many years into the Pro-Com War it became clear that Loyalist Commanders would be imperative to a Progenitor Coalition victory. Seizing upon this, Progenitor High Command decided to use one of their best, Loyalist Commander Grant, as bait to lure Machine Liberation Army Commander Barca into a trap. Knowing that Barca was operating near the system, Grant entered Zeta Draconis and prepared his trap. Eventually, Barca entered the system and immediately detected Grant. Locating the Loyalist, Barca could see that Grant had been damaged, laying helpless next to an active volcano. Barca moved in for the kill. At the last instant, Grant rocketed into the air, detonating the hidden explosives buried in the side of the fiery mountain. Before he could react, Barca found a wave of lava washing over him. Grant would use the tactic successfully two more times before he was lost during the Battle of Cupru.",
